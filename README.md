# CodeIgniter + React TypeScript Starter

## What is This Project?

This project is a starter template that integrates CodeIgniter 4 with a React frontend built using TypeScript. It provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications.

## Installation & Setup

### Backend (CodeIgniter)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone your-repo-url
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Setup Environment**:
    Copy the `env` file to `.env` and configure your environment settings, especially the `baseURL` and database configurations.
    
4. **Run Migrations**:

    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Serve the Built Files**:
    Move the built files from `frontend/dist` to CodeIgniter's `public` directory:
    ```bash
    cp -r dist/* ../public/
    ```

## Serving the Application

1. **Start the CodeIgniter Server**:
    ```bash
    php spark serve
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the base URL you configured.

## Folder Structure
